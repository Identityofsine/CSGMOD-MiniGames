# CSS/GMOD MiniGames
This project is created for fun.

## What is this project for?
What this project aims to do is to translate the experience, mechanics, and gameplay of Counter-Strike Source Minigames(or otherwise known as mg_*.bsp maps) into Garry's Mod, where the possiblites are endless. 

The goal is to first emulate the gameplay of counter-strike: Rounds, Weapons, Maps, and Models, then to add our own twist into the game. With CSS it is hard to create modifications to the game(compared to GMod), in our vision we want to enhance the experience rather then change it.

This project is literally made so I could 
- Code Something
- Play it

## Features
- Basic CSS Functions, Weapons, Models
- RTV
- I haven't thought of any yet

## End Goals

At the end, this project should be completely functional (meaning at most should emulate counter-strike source, have an RTV system and have a round system), but I would like to take it past baseline and add simple minute features(which I haven't thought of yet). 

At the end of the project their should be a server where people could join and come together to replay memories from their youth. This server will not be permanent however, I do not feel like maintaing a server, a community, and an entire gamemode. This is why it is open-source. 
If somehow, somebody discovers this, discovers that I haven't contributed in 6 years, thinks that this is a great idea that they want to build upon. If that person is you, be my guest and please show me what you create.
