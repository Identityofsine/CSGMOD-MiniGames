#CSS/GMOD MiniGames
- This project is created for fun.

What this project aims to do is to translate the experience, mechanics, and gameplay of Counter-Strike Source Minigames(or otherwise known as mg_*.bsp maps) into Garry's Mod, where the possiblites are endless. 

At the end of the project their should be a server where people could join and come together to replay memories from their youth. This server will not be permanent however, I do not feel like maintaing a server, a community, and an entire gamemode. This is why it is open-source. 
If somehow, somebody discovers this, discovers that I haven't contributed in 6 years, thinks that this is a great idea that they want to build upon. If that person is you, be my guest and please show me what you create.
