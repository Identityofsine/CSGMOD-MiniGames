# CSS/GMOD MiniGames
This project is created for fun.

## What is this project for?
This project seeks to bring the exciting experience, intricate mechanics, and engaging gameplay of Counter-Strike Source Minigames, commonly known as mg_*.bsp maps, to Garry's Mod, where the creative possibilities are limitless.

Our primary objective is to replicate the core gameplay of Counter-Strike, including the various rounds, weapons, maps, and models, before introducing our unique twist to the game. While modifying Counter-Strike Source can be challenging, we aim to elevate the experience by enhancing the existing gameplay without fundamentally altering it.

In essence, this project represents our passion for gaming and our desire to create an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience for others who share our enthusiasm.

This project is literally made so I could 
- Code Something
- Play it

## Features
- Basic CSS Functions, Weapons, Models
- RTV
- I haven't thought of any yet

## End Goals

This project is intended to be fully functional, with the ability to emulate Counter-Strike Source, including an RTV system and a round system. However, I'm not content with just meeting the baseline requirements and would like to incorporate additional minute features that I have yet to consider.

Ultimately, my goal is to create a server where individuals can come together to relive fond memories of their youth. While I'm not planning on maintaining this server indefinitely, I want to make the project open-source to encourage others to build upon it. If, in the future, someone discovers this project and decides to take it to the next level, I welcome them to do so and would be excited to see what they create.
