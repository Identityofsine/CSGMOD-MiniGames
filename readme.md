# CSS/GMOD MiniGames
This project is created for fun.

## What is this project for?
This project seeks to bring the exciting experience, intricate mechanics, and engaging gameplay of Counter-Strike Source Minigames, commonly known as mg_*.bsp maps, to Garry's Mod, where the creative possibilities are limitless.

Our primary objective is to replicate the core gameplay of Counter-Strike, including the various rounds, weapons, maps, and models, before introducing our unique twist to the game. While modifying Counter-Strike Source can be challenging, we aim to elevate the experience by enhancing the existing gameplay without fundamentally altering it.

In essence, this project represents our passion for gaming and our desire to create an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience for others who share our enthusiasm.

This project is literally made so I could 
- Code Something
- Play it

## Features
- Basic CSS Functions, Weapons, Models
- RTV
- I haven't thought of any yet

## End Goals

At the end, this project should be completely functional (meaning at most should emulate counter-strike source, have an RTV system and have a round system), but I would like to take it past baseline and add simple minute features(which I haven't thought of yet). 

At the end of the project their should be a server where people could join and come together to replay memories from their youth. This server will not be permanent however, I do not feel like maintaing a server, a community, and an entire gamemode. This is why it is open-source. 
If somehow, somebody discovers this, discovers that I haven't contributed in 6 years, thinks that this is a great idea that they want to build upon. If that person is you, be my guest and please show me what you create.
